VTT is a novel kind of modular self-reconfigurable robot (MSRR). The idea behind modular robots is that instead of building a single complicated robot, we can build a collection of composable robot modules. By snapping the modules together in different ways, we can make a variety of robot shapes with different capabilities. These robot configurations wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be as efficient as a custom-built robot for any single task, but the ability to reconfigure means that the whole system can accomplish a much wider variety of tasks. Self-reconfigurable modular robots takes this one step further: the robot can rearrange itself without human intervention. This is especially attractive for scenarios like autonomous space missions, where the payload weight is limited but a wide variety of tasks will need to be addressed, some of which might be not be planned in advance.\nMost proposed MSRR systems use cube-like modules that can connect on a lattice or link together as a chain. One example developed here at Penn is SMORES, which can do both lattice and chain-style reconfiguration. However, this cube-like foundation presents some issues with scaling the system up. These systems tend to have poor structural efficiency and actuation capability.\nThe idea with VTT is to change the underlying architecture to make the system much stronger and lighter. Instead of using cube elements, we will use extendable beam elements as the fundamental building block. If traditional modular robots are like using bricks to build an arch bridge, then VTT is like using beams to build a structurally efficient truss bridge. Here is what these beam modules look like:\nWith these modules, we can build a variety of 3D truss structures. At the top of this page, you can see us giving a live demo of an octahedron configuration at ICRA 2022. Robotic trusses built with these modules can morph their shape to move around in the world, and the system can even change its own configuration using special self-reconfigurable joints.\nMy main research work concerns the reconfiguration and motion planning problem. That is, given some start and goal configurations\u0026mdash;for example, the two trusses shown below\u0026mdash;how can we find some sequence of robot motions to transform into the goal? The parallel nature of the truss robot architecture makes this a surprisingly challenging problem.\nAside from motion planning, I also work on the hardware design and control software for the robot. Developing this robot system has been a collaborative effort from many Modlab members, but I have led the hardware design for the last few years. I have also redesigned the electronics, updated the messaging system, and rewritten the control software in ROS2.\n","date":"14 May 2023","permalink":"/projects/vtt-overview/","section":"Projects","summary":"A quick overview of the VTT robot.

The closing mechanism can be triggered automatically when one set of legs brushes up against the branch. When it is time to take off again, an internal pusher plate extracts the teeth from the branch.\n","date":"2 May 2023","permalink":"/projects/senior-design/","section":"Projects","summary":"Enabling quadrotors to grab tree branches.","title":"Senior Design: Quadrotor Perching"},{"content":" While at Johns Hopkins, I did some summer research with Professor Dan Stoianovici at the JHU Bayview Medical Campus. His lab builds robots that can work inside an MRI scanner, which means they cannot use any magnetic or electrical parts. The motors are plastic pneumatic stepper motors, and encoder signals are sent by fiber optic cable instead of copper wire.\nMy role was to develop a simpler, low-cost solution to test the pneumatic stepper motors. I developed an Arduino-based system to allow a user to control multiple motors at a time. Commands could be issued by navigating a UI on an LCD screen with push buttons, or the system could be plugged into a computer to use a clickable GUI.\nI also helped investigate some alternative plastic motor designs, including a pneumatic gerotor. My contribution was to write Matlab code to generate trochoid curves that we could import into Creo to manufacture the inner and outer gears.\n","date":"1 May 2023","permalink":"/projects/urobotics/","section":"Projects","summary":"Undergraduate research on MR-compatible robots.","title":"URobotics Research"},{"content":"I am a PhD student in the Penn GRASP lab, planning to graduate in August 2023. Although my degree will be in Mechanical Engineering, I have broad experience in various aspects of robotics research.\nMy main research project at Penn is the development of the Variable Topology Truss (VTT) robot system. This is a modular robot system where each module is a linear actuator, and the modules are connected together to form a rigid truss. By actuating the length of each truss member, the whole truss can morph its shape and move around. Not only that, but the robot can self-reconfigure the connections between the truss members, allowing the robot to modify its topology beyond simple shape morphing (hence the name). For more details about this research, check out the VTT page on the Modlab website for general information and my personal page for my publications and blog posts about the robot.\nBefore coming to Penn, I got my bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University. At JHU, I led the Design, Build, Fly team, which designs fixed-wing RC aircraft for a competition. Other projects from that time include an attachment for a quadrotor to allow it to perch on tree branches and a pneumatic motor for MR-compatible medical robots.\nPhoto by Justin Nachea ","date":"23 October 2021","permalink":"/bio/","section":"","summary":"I am a PhD student in the Penn GRASP lab, planning to graduate in August 2023.
