I am a robotics research scientist at Johns Hopkins APL, where I work on multi-robot planning and the design of novel robot hardware.
I recently graduated with my PhD from Penn.
Although my degree was in Mechanical Engineering, I have broad experience in various aspects of robotics research.


My main research project at Penn was the development of the Variable Topology Truss (VTT) robot system.
This is a modular robot system where each module is a linear actuator, and the modules are connected together to form a rigid truss.
By actuating the length of each truss member, the whole truss can morph its shape and move around.
Not only that, but the robot can self-reconfigure the connections between the truss members, allowing the robot to modify its _topology_ beyond simple shape morphing (hence the name).
For more details about this research, check out the [VTT page](https://www.modlabupenn.org/variable-topology-truss/) on the Modlab website for general information and [my personal page](https://www.modlabupenn.org/people/alexander-spinos/) for my publications and blog posts about the robot.

Before pursuing my PhD at Penn, I got my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University.
At JHU, I led the Design, Build, Fly team, which designs fixed-wing RC aircraft for a competition.
Other projects from that time include an attachment for a quadrotor to allow it to perch on tree branches and a pneumatic motor for MR-compatible medical robots.
