For the senior design project at Johns Hopkins, our team designed and built a gripper that can be attached to quadrotors to allow them to perch on tree branches.
The gripper has sharp teeth and a spring-loaded mechanism that allows it to snap closed and securely grab a tree branch.
The closing mechanism can be triggered automatically when one set of legs brushes up against the branch.
When it is time to take off again, an internal pusher plate extracts the teeth from the branch.
