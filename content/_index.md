I am a robotics research scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab.
[Read more about me.]({{< ref "/bio" >}} "Bio")

Before joining APL, I got my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Professor Mark Yim in the Modlab group within GRASP.
My research centered around the Variable Topology Truss (VTT), a modular self-reconfigurable parallel robot.
My interests and experiences include leading research projects, designing novel mechanisms and robot hardware, writing software for analyzing and controlling robots, and leveraging techniques from graph theory and knot theory to accelerate robot motion planning.
