My research centers around the Variable Topology Truss (VTT), a modular self-reconfigurable parallel robot.
My interests and experiences include leading research projects, designing novel mechanisms and robot hardware, writing software for analyzing and controlling robots, and leveraging techniques from graph theory and knot theory to accelerate robot motion planning.
